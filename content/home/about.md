# Biography

I am an ex-Neuroscientist now working on Artificial General Intelligence. I'm working as a Research Scientist at [DeepMind](http://www.deepmind.com), more precisely on Concepts understanding.

Basically mostly playing around with unsupervised learning, structure learning and generative models; applying them to Deep Reinforcement Learning like an ex-Neuroscientist would :smiley:
